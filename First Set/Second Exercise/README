Object-Oriented Programming
1st Set-Second Exercise


Manual:

	To compile this program write to the
terminal the command "make". To delete the 
executable and the object files write the
command "make clean"

To execute the program the command line must
have the following form:

./Airport_Simulator <duration of flow time>

where this parameter is an integer.

Notes:

	My program runs until it doesn't have
a flight and an application to read. And does
the following loop:

->Calls show_timetable()
->Calls flow_time()
->Cancells a random flight
->Fills the empty terminals
->Moves the applications which found a matching
flight from waiting list to the matching flight.

Moreover, the applications on the file have the 
following input format:

<ID> <First Name> <Last Name> <Destination>
<Time to airport> <Desirable time to destination>
<Seat type>

The flights on the file have following input format:

<Destination> <Depart time> <Flight duration>
<Max seats at economy class> <Max seats at luxury class>
